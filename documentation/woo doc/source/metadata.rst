Understanding the SYNC METADATA Button
---------------------------------------

The "SYNC METADATA" button is a key feature of the Odoo Woocommerce Connector, designed to simplify and streamline the synchronization of essential metadata between Odoo and WooCommerce. This functionality plays a vital role in maintaining data accuracy and consistency.

When you click the "SYNC METADATA" button, the connector performs the following actions:

1. **Importing State and Country Data**: The connector retrieves state and country information from your WooCommerce platform and ensures that this data is up-to-date in your Odoo instance. This is particularly important for order fulfillment and addressing.

2. **WooCommerce Settings**: WooCommerce platform settings and configurations are synchronized to Odoo. This includes WooCommerce-specific settings that impact the behavior of your online store. It also contains Tax policy data for accurate tax calculations in both Odoo and WooCommerce. The "SYNC METADATA" action ensures that tax policies are synchronized and consistent across platforms.
